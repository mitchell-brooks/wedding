An over-engineered landing page for the digital Save the Date for our upcoming wedding.

Site is built in **React** on **NextJS** with **Nx** monorepo scaffold.

The site uses **Styled Components** for styling.

Monorepo was conceived of to allow for additional wedding-related sites to be built later and share resources, but we ultimately decided to use a pre-built solution for our main wedding site for convenience.
